                        Apache Commons JCS
                        Version 3.2.1
                        Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

This document contains the release notes for the 3.2.1 version of Apache Commons JCS.
Commons JCS is a distributed caching system written in Java. It is intend to speed up 
applications by providing a means to manage cached data of various dynamic natures.

JCS 3.0 and onwards now targets Java 8.0, making use of features that arrived with Java 8.0 
such as lambdas.

For the advice on upgrading from 2.x to 3.x, see the following page: 

    http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jcs/UpgradingFrom2x.html

NOTE: Some JCS tests require a working multicast setup. They are disabled by default.
If you are sure that your network configuration supports multicast (most VPNs do not,
for example), you may enable the additional tests with "-P testWithMulticast".
