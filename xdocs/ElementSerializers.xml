		<section name="Serializing and De-serializing Cache Objects">
			<p> When using auxiliary caches, cache elements need to be serialized 
                into a byte stream in order to be stored on disk or transported 
                through a network. For reading from these caches, bytes must be 
                de-serialized into objects. By default, JCS uses the standard JDK
                methods for serializing and de-serializing objects. However, all 
                of the auxiliaries also support setting a custom serializer to 
                have finer control of the behavior.</p>
                
			<p> This document describes the built-in serializers and their 
                configuration.</p>
		</section>
		<section name="Standard Serializer">
			<p> The <code>StandardSerializer</code> uses the JDK default 
			    serialization methods. Key and value classes must be 
			    <code>Serializable</code> for this to work.</p>
			<p> De-serialization of objects out of untrusted data is a common
			    source for vulnerabilities in code. JCS implements an 
			    <code>ObjectInputFilter</code> to address this problem. The filter
			    for classes and packages allowed for de-serialization can be 
			    configured with a system property:</p>

                ]]>
            </source>
			<p> The syntax for the filter expression is documented in the JavaDoc
                of <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/io/ObjectInputFilter.Config.html#createFilter-java.lang.String-">java.io.ObjectInputFilter.Config#createFilter</a>.</p>

        <section name="Compressing Serializer">
            <p> The <code>CompressingSerializer</code> gzips the bytes
                after serializing the cache object the default way. For reading, 
                the bytes will be de-compressed first and then de-serialized into 
                a Java object. The class can also be used as a wrapper around an
                arbitrary class implementing <code>IElementSerializer</code>.</p>
                
            <p> The configuration for a typical application looks like this:</p>

        <section name="Encrypting Serializer">
            <p> The <code>EncryptingSerializer</code> uses AES to encrypt the bytes
                after serializing the cache object the default way. For reading, 
                the bytes will be decrypted first and then de-serialized into 
                a Java object. The class can also be used as a wrapper around an
                arbitrary class implementing <code>IElementSerializer</code>.</p>

            <p> The implementation uses a symmetrical pre-shared key phrase for 
                encrypting and decrypting the data. The key is salted separately
                for each object and the salt is stored together with the serialized
                data.</p>

            <p> The AES cipher transformation default is AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding as this 
                algorithm must be supported by every JDK 8, according to the 
                <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/Cipher.html">docs</a>. 
                Special handling is provided for the AES/GCM/NoPadding algorithm which 
                can be activated like this:</p>
            <source>

jcs.auxiliary.blockDiskCache2.serializer.attributes.aesCipherTransformation=AES/GCM/NoPadding
                ]]>
            </source>

            <p> The encryption code uses the default constructor of SecureRandom() to create
                a random number generator. Depending on your security requirements, you should
                configure a SecureRandom that works for your environment, giving preference to 
                the ones with good randomness (given that your environment generates entropy fast 
                enough, we saw problems with Linux).</p>
        </section>
        <section name="JSON Serializer">
            <p> The <code>JSONSerializer</code> serializes the cache object to a UTF-8-encoded
                JSON string. The Java class name information for de-serialization is preserved 
                in a separate <code>className</code> field. This serializer can be used to 
                exchange data between different platforms or when text representations are 
                required.</p>

            <p> Note that for this to work properly, you need to open your data objects packages 
                to Jackson DataBind in your <code>module-info.java</code>:</p>
