      <p>
        The Lateral JGroups Auxiliary Cache is an optional plug in for
        JCS.  It is primarily intended to broadcast puts and removals to
        other local caches, though it can also get cached objects.  It uses JGroups
        for distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
		The Lateral Lateral JGroups Auxiliary Cache is far slower than
		that Lateral TCP Auxiliary Cache.  Since the Lateral TCP Auxiliary
		is faster and has UDP discovery built in, the TCP auxiliary is the recommended form of lateral
		distribution.  However, the JGroups Auxiliary requires fewer socket connections than
		the TCP lateral.
      </p>
      <p>
		A functional configuration example is below:
